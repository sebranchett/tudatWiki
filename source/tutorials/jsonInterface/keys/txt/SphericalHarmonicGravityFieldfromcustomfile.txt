path | file | Path to a PDS file containing the cosine and sine coefficients. Each row contains a degree, order, cosine coefficient and sine coefficient. | m

string | associatedReferenceFrame | Identifier of the associated reference frame, e.g. :literal:`IAU_Earth`. | m

number | maximumDegree | Maximum degree of the coefficients to be loaded from the file. | m

number | maximumOrder | Maximum order of the coefficients to be loaded from the file. | m

number | gravitationalParameterIndex | Index (starting from zero) at which the associated gravitational parameter of the model can be found in a vector resulting from splitting the first line of the input file (aka header). Must be set to :literal:`-1` if the file has no header. | m | 0

number | referenceRadiusIndex | Index (starting from zero) at which the associated reference radius of the model can be found in a vector resulting from splitting the header. Must be set to :literal:`-1` if the file has no header. | m | 1

number | gravitationalParameter | Value of the gravitational parameter, to be provided if the file has no header. | m:gravitationalParameterIndex=-1

number | referenceRadius | Value of the reference radius, to be provided if the file has no header. | m:referenceRadiusIndex=-1

string | integratedStateType |  | o | translational | translational, mass, rotational

string[ ] | bodiesToPropagate | Names of the bodies to propagate. | m

number[ ]Â | initialStates | Vector containing the concatenated initial states of all the bodies to be propagated. If not defined, it will be determined from the properties :jsonkey:`initialState`, :jsonkey:`mass` or :jsonkey:`rotationalState` of the bodies to be propagated. If all the bodies to propagate are celestial bodies and this property is not defined, the ephemeris at the initial epoch will be used. | o

- Translational Propagator
- Mass Propagator
- Rotational Propagator

object | variable | Variable the termination condition is associated to. Currently, a termination condition can only be defined as a function of the independent variable, the CPU-time variable or a dependent variable. For the independent and CPU-time variables, the key :jsonkey:`lowerLimit` is ignored. | m
+ Variable

number | lowerLimit | The propagation will terminate if the value of :jsonkey:`variable` is smaller than this value (or larger than :jsonkey:`upperLimit` if defined). | m:!upperLimit

number | upperLimit | The propagation will terminate if the value of :jsonkey:`variable` is larger than this value (or smaller than :jsonkey:`lowerLimit` if defined). | m:!lowerLimit

string | coefficientsType |  | o | constant | constant, tabulated

number | referenceArea | Reference area with which aerodynamic forces and moments are non-dimensionalized. If not specified, it will be retrieved from the body's :jsonkey:`referenceArea` key. | o

number | referenceLength | Reference length with which aerodynamic moments are non-dimensionalized. | m:if moment coefficients provided

number | lateralReferenceLength | Lateral reference length with which aerodynamic moments are non-dimensionalized. | m:if moment coefficients provided

number | momentReferencePoint | Point w.r.t. which the arm of the moment on a vehicle panel is determined. | m:if moment coefficients provided

string[ ] | independentVariableNames | Vector with identifiers of the physical meaning of each independent variable of the aerodynamic coefficients. | o |  | machNumber, angleOfAttack, angleOfSideslip, altitude, controlSurfaceDeflection, undefined

boolean | areCoefficientsInAerodynamicFrame | Boolean to define whether the aerodynamic coefficients are defined in the aerodynamic frame (lift, drag, side force) or in the body frame (typically denoted as Cx, Cy, Cz). | o | FIXME

boolean | areCoefficientsInNegativeAxisDirection | Boolean to define whether the aerodynamic coefficients are positive along the positive axes of the body or aerodynamic frame. FIXME Note that for (lift, drag, side force), the coefficients are typically defined in negative direction. | o | true

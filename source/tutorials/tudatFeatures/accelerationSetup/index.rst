Setting up State Derivative Models
==================================

Here, we go into detail on how to set up state derivative models, such as accelerations, torques and mass-rate models, in Tudat. The design of the state derivative interfaces is discussed in detail for the acceleration models. Setup of the other state derivative models (rotation, mass) follows a similar approach. For the aerodynamic and thrust forces, we provide dedicated wiki pages.

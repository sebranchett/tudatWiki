==========

The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a powerful set of C++ libraries that support astrodynamics and space research. These libraries are publicly available on Github (https://github.com/Tudat) for anyone to use and contribute to. The pages contained in this wiki provide an overview of all the guides, introductions, tutorials and feature documentation of the main building blocks of Tudat.

Tudat includes a wide variety of libraries, all the way from gravity models to numerical integrators and other mathematical tools. One of the key strengths within Tudat is its ability to combine such libraries in a powerful simulator framework. Such framework can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the study of reentry dynamics, interplanetary missions, etc. An example of a Tudat output is given in the animation below, which shows the orbits of the 30-satellite Galileo constellation.

A detailed list containing the features and applications of Tudat is given here:

- Choices of various, fixed and variable step-size, integrators, including: Runge-Kutta 4, Runge-Kutta variable step-size (various orders), Bulirsch-Stoer, and Adams-Bashfort-Moulton. 
- Propagation of the translational state, rotational state, mass, or any user defined state derivative function. With various options for the terminal conditions and dependent variables that are derived from the state.
- Propagation of not only the state, but also the variational equations assosciated with the dynamics.
- Options to include environments of solar-system bodies in the simulation, e.g. gravity fields, atmosphere, orbits and rotations of various planets, and a radiation environment (for the calculation of radiation pressure).
- Options to include acceleration models, e.g. point mass gravity, spherical harmonics gravity, aerodynamics, radiation pressure, and thrust.
- Building of a custom made, or pre-defined, aerodynamic guidance model and/or thrust guidance model. 
- Defining a vehicle to be used in the simulation, for which the mass, aerodynamic coefficients, reference area, orientation, and various other parameters can be defined by the user. 
- Interfaces with JSON and MATLAB.
- Extensive documentation and tutorials found on this website.

Tudat has also been used extensively in research projects, a few of them are listed below:

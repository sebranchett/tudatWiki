Setup Development Environment
=============================

The first step is to set up the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will be used to write, compile and run your code. We recommend to use `Qt Creator <https://www.qt.io/ide/>`_ as your IDE due to its multi-platform capability and its popularity among students and staff. Note that the compiler and the precise installation steps will vary depending on your OS, so please refer to the section that is relevant to you.

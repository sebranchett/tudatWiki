Getting Started with Tudat
==========================


These pages of the wiki will help you build up your knowledge basis on a few C++ features, that will help you to get started with Tudat. We do not provide an introduction to the C++ language here, such introductions can be found in many literature sources, or web pages such as `this one <http://www.cplusplus.com/>`_ . 

On our wiki, we give a descrption of a few features of the  :literal:`Eigen` and :literal:`boost` external libraries, which support the development using Tudat. Before proceeding, make sure you are familiar with the basic concepts of the :literal:`Eigen` library, described below, as well as the :literal:`shared_ptr` and :literal:`make_shared` functionality of the boost library.

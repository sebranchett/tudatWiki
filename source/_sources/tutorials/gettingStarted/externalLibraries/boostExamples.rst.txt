Boost: Usage Examples
=====================
This page provides some examples on how to use :class:`shared_ptr`, :class:`make_shared`, :class:`function` and :class:`bind`, which were introduced on the Boost page, at application level and in combination with Tudat. Note that the first two are crucial for any Tudat user. The documentation on :class:`function`/:class:`bind` should be consulted only when working on feature development. The example of :class:`bind` also includes the use of the RK4 numerical integrator from Tudat.

shared_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~

    The boost :class:`shared_ptr` is a template class that stores a smart pointer to a dynamically allocated object. Generally, it behaves much like a normal C++ pointer but should be used instead, because it is more safe. Use of this pointer ensures that the object pointed to is destroyed when the last :class:`shared_ptr` to the object is destroyed or reset. Thus, this feature provides automatic memory management and prevents memory leaks. Also, this eliminates the use of explicit delete statements.

    **Example description**
        This example considers a shared pointer to a :class:`TestBody` class. This "TestBody" class is essentially a stripped-down version of the full ``Body`` class used in Tudat. For this example it is assumed that the code for this class is in your application folder. The code of this small TestBody class is given at the end of this page.

        The constructor of the TestBody class is:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            TestBody( const Eigen::Vector6d& aState, const double aTime = 0.0 );

        where the input of the constructor is a state vector (in Cartesian elements) and the time, which has the default value 0.0. Assume that the state vector in Cartesian elements is known: initialState.

    **Include statements**
        For this example, the following include statement is required:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            #include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>

        Generally, this include statement is required when using shared pointers in your code. Furthermore, the code of the "TestBody" class should be included, either above the main function or as a separate header and source file.

    **Defining the shared pointer type**
        The boost :class:`shared_ptr` class is a template class that stores a smart pointer to a dynamically allocated object. Generally, it is of the following form:

        .. code-block:: cpp
        
            boost::shared_ptr< objectType >
    
        where ``boost::shared_ptr`` is used to indicate that it is a shared pointer, and ``objectType`` is the type of the object that it points to. The object type is placed in angular brackets, because it is a template parameter.

        The shared pointer to an object of the TestBody class can now be declared as:

        .. code-block:: cpp
        
            boost::shared_ptr< TestBody >

        The above type can be roughly considered as the 'equivalent' to the following raw pointer-type:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            TestBody*

    **shared_ptr typedef**
        It can be convenient to create a typedef for the :class:`shared_ptr` to a TestBody class as follows:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            typedef boost::shared_ptr< TestBody > TestBodyPointer;

        Such a typedef can be placed in the header file of the class below the class itself, or in the main function. Within Tudat you will see many typedefs for shared pointers. Creating such a type definition makes it easier to read the code.

    **Creating a boost shared pointer**
       In our main function, we now want to create a shared pointer to an object of the TestBody class, we will name the pointer ``exampleTestBodyPointer``. We can use the following code to create the :class:`shared_ptr`:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::shared_ptr< TestBody > exampleTestBodyPointer( new TestBody( initialState ) );

        where: 

        - ``boost::shared_ptr< TestBody >`` is the type: a shared pointer to an object of type :class:`TestBody`.
        - ``exampleTestBodyPointer`` is the name of the object-pointer.
        - ``new`` is used to dynamically allocate the memory to the object.
        - ``TestBody( )`` is the call to the constructor of the :class:`TestBody` class.
        - ``initialState`` is the input to the TestBody class constructor.

        Note that the default value for aTime (0.0) is used. Equivalently, we can use the above typedef instead:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            TestBodyPointer exampleTestBodyPointer( new TestBody( initialState ) );

        The above line of code can be roughly considered as the :class:`shared_ptr` 'equivalent' to the following raw pointer code:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            TestBody* exampleTestBodyPointer = new TestBody( initialState );

make_shared
~~~~~~~~~~~

    Boost :class:`make_shared` is a factory function that creates an object of a given type and returns a :class:`shared_ptr` to it. This way the explicit use of ``new`` is avoided.

    **Example description**
        For this example, again consider the constructor of the TestBody class (see the :class:`shared_ptr` example), and assume that the input state is known: ``initialState``.

    **Include statements**
        For this example the following include statements are required:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            #include <boost/make_shared.hpp>
            #include <boost/shared_ptr.hpp>

        Generally, when using make_shared in your code, the first statement should be included.

    **Creating a boost shared pointer using make_shared**
        In our main function, we again want to create a shared pointer to an object of the :class:`TestBody` class, which we will name ``newExampleTestBodyPointer``. Now we will create it using boost's :class:`make_shared`:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::shared_ptr< TestBody > newExampleTestBodyPointer = boost::make_shared< TestBody >( initialState );

        where:
    
        - ``boost::shared_ptr< TestBody >`` is the type: a shared pointer to an object of type :class:`TestBody`.
        - ``newExampleTestBodyPointer`` is the name of the object-pointer.
        - ``boost::make_shared< TestBody >`` is the factory function that creates an object of type :class:`TestBody` and returns a shared pointer to it.
        - ``( initialState )`` is the input to the :class:`TestBody` class constructor.

        The above line of code can be roughly considered as the :class:`shared_ptr` and :class:`make_shared` 'equivalent' to the following raw pointer code:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            TestBody* asterix = new TestBody( asterixInitialState );

        Note that the :class:`make_shared` constructor cannot take more that 10 arguments. If you want to construct a shared pointer to an object that requires more than 10 arguments, use the following code instead:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::shared_ptr< objectType > newExampleTestBodyPointer( new objectType( input1, input2, ..., inputN ) ); // Where N > 10.

.. _externalBoostExamplesFunction:

function
~~~~~~~~

    The  boost function library contains a family of class templates that are function object wrappers. It is used in Tudat instead of a normal C++ function pointer because it is an easy way to pass a function as an input to another object or function. Specifically, it allows the passing of free functions and class member functions with a single interface. The boost function type defines both its input types (and order) and its output type. Any function that fits this profile is accepted when it is passed.

    **Example description**
        For this example, we will show the use of :class:`function` with a free function. The example with a member function is shown in the :class:`bind` example below. We use the Himmelblau function as an example:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            f( x, y ) = ( x 2 + y - 11 )^2 + ( x + y 2 - 7 )^2

        For which we have the following C++ free function:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            double himmelblau( double x, double y )
            {
                return ( ( x * x + y - 11.0 ) * ( x * x + y - 11.0 )
                         + ( x + y * y - 7.0 ) * ( x + y * y - 7.0 ) );
            }

    **Include statements**
        For this example, the following include statement is required:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            #include <boost/function.hpp> 

       Generally, when using :class:`function` in your code, this include statement is required.

    **Defining the boost function type**
        The :class:`function` type that corresponds to the Himmelblau function defined above is:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< double ( double, double ) >;

        where the parameters between the angular brackets are the template parameters. These parameters comply to the form:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            < output ( input(s) ) >

        where ``output`` is the output type and ``input(s)`` is the type of the input, this can be a list of input arguments.

    **Creating a boost function pointer**
        In our main function, we want to create a function pointer that complies to this form, which we name ``exampleFunction``. We can use the following code to create the function pointer:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< double ( double, double ) > exampleFunction = &himmelblau;

        where:

        - ``boost::function< double ( double, double ) >`` is the type of exampleFunction, which describes the form of the function (input: double, double; output: double).
        - ``exampleFunction`` is the name of the object.
        - ``&himmelblau`` is the function object that is assigned (note the use of the ampersand &).

    **Using the function pointer**
        Later-on in the code the input argument to the function object ``exampleFunction`` can be provided using:
    
        .. code-block:: cpp

            double initialPoint = exampleFunction ( 0.0, 0.0 ); // Computes f( 0.0, 0.0 )
            double randomPoint = exampleFunction ( -5.0, 3.0 ); // Computes f( -5.0, 3.0 )

        Here, the input values (0.0, 0.0 and -5.0, 3.0 respectively) are routed to the function ``himmelblau``, where the output is computed.

    **Results**
        Using the code that was discussed in this example, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            x
            y
            f(x,y)
            3.0
            2.0
            0.0
            -3.779310
            -3.283189
            4.24634e-010
            -2.0
            3.0
            16.0
            0.0
            0.0
            170.0

    **Creating a function returning a constant value**
        There are cases in which you will want to create a function that always returns the same value, without any reference to a specific implementation. This is achieved by using the ``boost::lambda::constant`` function. This function can be created as follows:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< double( ) > testFunction = boost::lambda::constant( 3.0 );

        Now, if at any point in the code, the following is called:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            double testValue = testFunction( );

        will result in testValue holding the value 3.0. The same trick can be used for any other type than a double. For instance:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< Eigen::Vector3d( ) > testVectorFunction = boost::lambda::constant( Eigen::Vector3d::UnitX( ) );

        will create a function that always returns the (1,0,0) vector. Also, this interface can be used for boost functions requiring inputs, so that:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< double( const double ) > testFunction = boost::lambda::constant( 3.0 );
           double inputValue = 20.0;
            double testValue = testFunction( inputValue );

        will ignore the input to ``testFunction`` and again assign 3.0 to the ``testValue`` variable.

bind
~~~~

    The boost bind library implements a simple and versatile function argument binding mechanism. This boost feature is used in Tudat because it is a good way to pass function objects. Its use is required for a unified free function and member function interface when using a class method, due to the way C++ calls function methods1.

    When using boost bind in your code, it can take many forms, varying where the class method is called (e.g. outside or inside the class), and varying the use of placeholders. This example considers the use of placeholders and calling from outside or inside a class.

    **Example description**
        The example described here is that of a Skydiver who starts its fall from an altitude of 25 kilometers. We are interested in its position and velocity after 50 seconds of free fall. The following assumptions are made:

        - The Earth and the Skydiver are modeled as point masses.
        - Variations in Earth's gravity with altitude are ignored.
        - All perturbations are neglected.
        - The following data is also needed for the calculations:
        - The initial altitude is 25 kilometers.
        - The initial velocity is 0 m/s.
        - The gravitational acceleration is constant at 9.81 m/s^2.
        - The Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) integrator is used with a fixed step size of 1 second.

    **Include statements**
        For this example, the following include statements are required:

            .. code-block:: cpp

                #include <boost/bind.hpp>
                #include <Eigen/Core>
               #include <Tudat/Mathematics/NumericalIntegrators/rungeKutta4Integrator.h>

        When using :class:`bind` in your code, the first include statement is required. To make use of ``Eigen`` types, the ``Core`` of Eigen is included as well. The last include statement is used for the RK4 integrator. For more information on Eigen, see Eigen. For more information on numerical integrators, see Tutorial Numerical Integrators

    **Calling from outside the class**
        First, an example is given when calling a class method from outside the class. For this we will define the ``Skydiver`` class, with a constructor and a function that computes the state derivative for its equations of motion:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            class Skydiver
            {
            public:
        
                //! Constructor of the Skydiver class.
                Skydiver( ){ }
        
                //! Compute the state derivative for given time and state.
                Eigen::Vector2d computeStateDerivative( const double time, const Eigen::Vector2d& state );

            protected:

            private:
            };

        The function to compute the state derivative is:

        .. code-block:: cpp

                Eigen::Vector2d Skydiver::computeStateDerivative( const double time, const Eigen::Vector2d& state )
                {
                // Note that the time is not used in this function, but it is required as input for the integrator.
                Eigen::Vector2d stateDerivative = Eigen::Vector2d::Zero( ); // Declare and initialize to zero.
                stateDerivative( 0 ) = state( 1 );  // Velocity
                stateDerivative( 1 ) = -9.81;       // Acceleration

                return stateDerivative;
            }

        The Skydiver class and function to compute the derivative can be placed above the main function (or alternatively in a separate header and source file). Inside the main function, first declare the constants that were given above. Declare these yourself:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            initialTime
            initialState // (which is of the type Eigen::Vector2d)
            timeStep
            endTime

        Then, our Skydiver testDiver is constructed:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            Skydiver testDiver;

        Next, an intermediate step is taken, before defining the integrator itself. The constructor of the RK4 integrator takes a state-derivative function, an initial time and an initial state. The state-derivative function is a :class:`function` type that corresponds to:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< Eigen::Vector2d ( const double, const Eigen::Vector2d ) >

        The state derivative is the class method ``computeStateDerivative`` of the Skydiver class, because this is a class method, :class:`bind` is used to create a function pointer to the state-derivative function:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            boost::function< Eigen::Vector2d ( const double, const Eigen::Vector2d ) > stateDerivativeFunction
                = boost::bind( &Skydiver::computeStateDerivative, &testDiver, _1, _2 );

        where:

        - ``boost::function< Eigen::Vector2d ( const double, const Eigen::Vector2d ) >`` is the type of stateDerivativeFunction, which describes the form of the function (input: double, Vector2d; output: Vector2d.
        - ``stateDerivativeFunction`` is the name of the object.
        - ``boost::bind( ... )`` is the call to boost::bind that binds the class method of the object testDiver to the object.
        - ``&Skydiver::computeStateDerivative`` is the member function of the Skydiver class that is bound (note the use of the ampersand &).
        - ``&testDiver`` is the object that the member function belongs to. Note the use of the ampersand &: this is used to pass a pointer to the object and not the object itself. Note that you can also pass a shared_ptr.
        - ``_1`` and ``_2`` specify placeholders. This is used to route the input arguments such that the input of the function can be provided later-on. In this case it specifies that the argument list for the computeStateDerivative function takes two arguments (time, state), and the order in which these arguments are taken.

        This ``boost::function`` can then be passed to the constructor of the integrator, the integrator is created as follows:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            tudat::mathematics::numerical_integrators::RungeKutta4IntegratorXd integrator(
                stateDerivativeFunction, initialTime, initialState );

        where:

        - ``RungeKuttaIntegratorXd`` is the type of the object created, which is the default ``RungeKutta4Integrator``.
        - ``integrator`` is the name of the object.
        - ``stateDerivativeFunction``, ``initialTime`` and ``initialState`` are the input arguments of the constructor of the RK4 integrator.

        Note that the previous two code fragments can also be coded as a single statement, which is more complex:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            tudat::mathematics::numerical_integrators::RungeKutta4IntegratorXd integrator(
                boost::bind( &Skydiver::computeStateDerivative, &testDiver, _1, _2 ),
                initialTime, initialState );

        The end state can now be computed using the class method integrateTo( ) of the integrator:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            const Eigen::Vector2d endState = integrator.integrateTo( endTime, timeStep );

    **Calling from inside the class**
        Second, an example is given when calling a class method from inside the class. For this we will modify the Skydiver class by adding a second class method:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            class Skydiver
            {
            public:

                //! Constructor of the Skydiver class.
                Skydiver( ){ }

                //! Compute the state derivative for given time and state.
                Eigen::Vector2d computeStateDerivative( const double time, const Eigen::Vector2d& state );

                //! Compute the final state for given initial conditions, final time and time step-size.
                Eigen::Vector2d computeFinalState( const double initialTime, const Eigen::Vector2d& initialState,
                                                   const double endTime, const double timeStep );

            protected: 

            private:
            };

        The function to compute the state derivative is the same as above, and the function to compute the final state is:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            Eigen::Vector2d Skydiver::computeFinalState( const double initialTime, const Eigen::Vector2d& initialState,
                                                     const double endTime, const double timeStep )
            {
                tudat::mathematics::numerical_integrators::RungeKutta4IntegratorXd integrator(
                            boost::bind( &Skydiver::computeStateDerivative, this, _1, _2 ),
                            initialTime, initialState );

                return integrator.integrateTo( endTime, timeStep );
            }

        Now, compare this function to the code of the previous example. The integrator is now used inside the class method ``computeFinalState``. This method calls the state derivative function from within the class. Do you notice the difference?

        Focus on the ``boost::bind`` call. In the previous example, the object that the method belonged to was ``testDiver``. Now, the class method is called from within the class and the object that the method belongs to is this. Did you spot it? Great! That is the difference between calling from outside or inside a class.

        As in the previous example, declare the constants that were given in the main function. In the same manner as before, also the ``testDiver`` is declared. Now the end state can be computed using:

        .. code-block:: cpp

            const Eigen::Vector2d endState = testDiver.computeFinalState( initialTime, initialState, endTime, timeStep );

    **Results**
        Using the code that was discussed in this example, you should be able to reproduce the following results:

        .. code-block:: cpp
        
            Time [s]
            Position [m]
            Velocity [m/s]
            10
            24509.5
            -98.1
            20
            23038
           -196.2
            50
           12737.5
           -490.5

        Note that the following explanation about function calls in C++ is a simplification of reality, and for a rigorous explanation refer to your local computer scientist. When a new instance of a class is created, this does not mean that all function definitions etc. are copied. There is only one copy of a function in memory, regardless of the amount of class instances. When a class method is called, the function is called with a hidden pointer to the class instance; this way the method knows about the class variables. When a class method is called via a function pointer, then the pointer to the class instance needs to be passed explicitly by the called. This is where :class:`bind` comes into the picture. The :class:`bind` function wraps a function into another object, and stores the passed arguments (which in the examples are respectively ``testDiver`` and this). When the function wrapper is eventually called, the function wrapper will call the wrapped function with both the arguments passed at its construction, as those passed to the call. The arguments passed to the function wrapper call are indicated with the ``_1``, respectively ``_2`` in the :class:`bind` call.

        .. code-block:: cpp

            /*!
             * This class serves as an example of how a data repository can be constructed that stores state

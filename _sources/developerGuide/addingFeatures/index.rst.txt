Adding Features to Tudat
========================
In some cases, the various features of Tudat do not contain the tool(s) to solve a specific problem. As Tudat is written in C++ and all the source code is readily available to the user, it is possible to add features to the Tudat software. This does require a good understanding of the C++ language and of how Tudat works, thus it is only recommended to users who have been working with Tudat before.

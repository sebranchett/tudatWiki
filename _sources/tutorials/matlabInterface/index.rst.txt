MATLAB Interface
================

.. warning:: The Matlab interface is currently unsupported by the Tudat support team. It has not been updated since fall 2017.	

These pages of the wiki describe how the MATLAB interface can be used to run Tudat-based propagations without the need to write C++ code and how input files for the :ref:`jsonInterface` can be easily generated.

Simulator Set-Up
================

One of the core elements of the Tudat libraries is its simulator framework. The goal of this page is discuss the implementation of such framework as well as the numerous options available. The top-level framework of the simulator is shown below:

The top-element in such framework is the :class:`DynamicsSimulator`, which is in charge of propagating the equations of motion using the environment and acceleration models discussed in :ref:`tudatFeaturesEnvironmentIndex` and :ref:`tudatFeaturesAccelerationIndex`, respectively. The orbit propation is done according to the specified :class:`IntegratorSettings` and the :class:`PropagatorSettings`, which are discussed in detail in :ref:`tudatFeaturesIntegratorSettings` and :ref:`tudatFeaturesPropagatorSettings`.

As shown in the figure above, there are various types of :class:`IntegratorSettings` and :class:`PropagatorSettings` depending on the particularities of the application at hand. For convenience, we list the types of dynamics that can be propagated, and their associated :class:`PropagatorSettings`:

**Propagator Settings**
    - Translational dynamics: :class:`TranslationalStatePropagatorSettings`
        This derived class defines the settings to propagate the translational dynamics.
    - Rotational dynamics: :class:`RotationalStatePropagatorSettings`
        This derived class defines the settings to propagate the rotational dynamics.
    - Mass variations: :class:`MassPropagationSettings`
        This derived class defines the settings to propagate the mass of a body.
    - User-defined dynamics type: :class:`CustomStatePropagatorSettings`
        This derived class allows the propagation of user-defined dynamics.
    - Multiple types of dynamics :class:`MultiTypePropagatorSettings`
        This derived class allows to propagate (in a single-arc) simultaneously any or all of the various propagator types defined above.
    - Multi-arc dynamics :class:`MultiArcPropagatorSettings`
        This derived class allows to propagate the dynamics over multiple arcs, using any of the above settings for the constituent arcs.

Similarly, the following integrators, and associated derived classes of :class:`IntegratorSettings` (if applicable), are available:

**Integrator Settings**
    - **Euler integrator**: (no derived class)
    - **Runge-Kutta 4** integrator: (no derived class)
    - **Variable step-size Runge-Kutta** integrators: :class:`RungeKuttaVariableStepSizeSettings`. The RKF4(5), RKF5(6), RKF7(8) and DOPRI8(7) coefficient sets are available.
    - **Variable step-size Adams-Bashforth-Moulton** integrator: :class:`AdamsBashforthMoultonSettings`
    - **Variable step-size, fixed order, Bulirsch-Stoer** integrator: :class:`BulirschStoerIntegratorSettings`

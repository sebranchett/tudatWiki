.. _setupDevelopmentEnvironmentWindows:

Install on Windows
------------------
This section of the guide refers to the installation of the IDE under Windows. These instructions should work for all versions of Windows from XP to Windows 10.

.. note:: Please make sure your user account name on Windows does not contain any non-latin characters as this is known to generate errors during compilation. If your user account contains such non-latin characters, create another account and download everything in that one.

.. note:: In the steps below it is assumed that you run a 64-bit version of Windows, also denoted as ``x64`` or ``x86_64`` in file names. All new hardware that is sold supports this architecture, but if you have an older computer (say, more than 9-10 years old), you might want to check if your version of Windows is 32 or 64 bit in the System information section in the Control Panel.

CMake
~~~~~
So, we are now going to walk through the process of installing CMake on your computer, after which we will install Qt Creator, which comes bundled with the compiler and related tools. We use CMake to manage software project(s), and to instruct your compiler how to generate and link libraries.

**Step 1: Download CMake**
    To download CMake, go to the `CMake website <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ and look for the Windows Installer ``cmake-[version]-win64-x64.msi`` at the top of table for Binary distributions. Click the link, and choose Run or Save (if available) in order to get the installer on your computer.

**Step 2: Install CMake**
    If your installer does not run automatically once the download has been completed, go to your Downloads directory and start the installer by double-clicking on it. Click on Run if your operating system tells you it does not recognize the publisher. You now get to the welcome screen for the CMake installer. You will have to press Next and accept the License Agreement (if you choose) and Next again. Now you will get to the Install Options. Make sure to select either Add CMake to the system PATH for *all users* (preferred) or *current user* (alternatively).

    .. note:: In rare cases, the installer will be unable to add CMake to your system path, because it is already too long (mind you the PATH list, not the CMake path, which is limited at 4095 characters). In this case choose "Add CMake to the PATH for current user" instead or try to clean up your system path manually.

**Step 3: Complete the installation**
    Finish the remainder of the installation. Leave the rest default (location and shortcuts).

SmartGit
~~~~~~~~

**Step 1: Download SmartGit**
    Download SmartGit for your operating system `here <http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/>`_. Note that for Linux the package might be available through your package manager, see Linux/Debian instructions. Note that SmartGit comes bundled with JRE (java runtime environment) on Windows and macOS. On Linux you need to install ``jre-openjdk``.

**Step 2: Install SmartGit**
    The installation should be straight-forward and the default installation is fine.

    .. note:: SmartGit is a GUI client for Git that was used in the past as the primary tool to retrieve the Tudat code. Even though we have moved to the use of a terminal, downloading SmartGit is required to prevent breaking the installation of Tudat (in particular the use of the ``tudat_shell.bat`` that you will encounter).

Qt Creator & MinGW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now we are going to walk through the process of installing Qt Creator on your computer. This will also install the MinGW, a Minimalist GNU Environment for Windows, containing (amongst others) GNU C++ compilers and Make programs.

**Step 1: Download the installer**
    To begin the installation, use the following link to download the installer for the Qt SDK: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ As before, it is best to choose to Run the installer directly.

**Step 2: Install Qt Creator**
    If you have selected Run, the installer should start automatically. If it does not start automatically, go to your downloads directory and start the installer by double-clicking on it.

    You will now see a welcome screen. You can "Skip" creating an account. Next the online installer will do some checks, this may take a few moments. You should get the option to specify the install directory, see the step below.

**Step 3: Set installation directory**
   Do not install Qt in the Program Files folder, but instead in your C:/ directory (or D:/ ...). Do not install it in the Program Files (x86) directory (or any directory with spaces), since this is known to cause issues later on.

**Step 4: Select custom installation components**
    Click Next until you get to the Select Components step. Here you get the option to select which parts of the Qt SDK you wish to install, shown below. Only Qt Creator (default, can not be unchecked) and MinGW (64-bit, 7.3.0) from the Tools section are necessary. The debugger is recommended.

    .. note:: It is highly recommended to have the 64-bit version of MinGW (7.3.0 when installing Qt creator). If your system does not support 64 bits, you can use the 5.3.0 MingW, but some code features may not be supported. The 32 bits version is also known to cause memory allocation troubles when compiling large applications that use many Tudat, Boost, and Pagmo libraries.

**Step 5: Complete the installation**
   Click Next to go to the License Agreement, where you find the license attached to the use of Qt. Scroll through it if you wish to know what you are accepting. Agree to the conditions and continue to the next step. You can choose to have shortcuts installed or not. Now you can click Install to start the installation. QtCreator and MinGW will be installed on your computer.

**Step 6: Configure Qt Creator**
   Open Qt Creator and go to Tools/Options. Under the *Kits* section, choose the *Kits* tab and select *Desktop* (on older versions of Qt, choose Build&Run -> Kits). Please verify the following:

   .. warning:: Diligently check whether the three points below are correctly set in your Qt Creator. Typically, more than half of installation issues occur due to users incorrectly following this step.

   .. figure:: images/compilerCheck.png

   .. note:: The image above refers to Qt version 4.4.1, whereas the latest version (at the time of writing, October 2018) is 4.7.2. In the newest version the *Kits* and *Build & Run* sections are separate.

Specifically:

    - The compiler is set to MinGW (7.3.0 highly recommended), shown above, in red.
    - The CMake tool is present, shown above in blue. Note that the name of the CMake tool may be different than below. If no CMake options are available,  go to the CMake tab and click 'Add'. Navigate to the directory where you installed cmake, and select :literal:`.../CMake/bin/cmake.exe` as the CMake tool.
    - The primary generator is ``MinGW`` and secondary generator is ``CodeBlocks``, shown above in green.

The next step is to download the Tudat bundle. Click next to go there.

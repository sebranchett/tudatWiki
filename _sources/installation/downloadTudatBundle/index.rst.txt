Download Tudat Bundle
=====================
The next step in the installation guide is to download the Tudat Bundle. This is a pre-configured setup that will allow us to get the libraries up and running in no time. The Tudat Bundle contains the following libraries:

- Tudat
- Boost (automatically downloaded and configured for your system when first building Tudat)
- Eigen
- cspice
- json
- nrlmsise-00
- pagmo2
- nlopt

Our recommended approach to download Tudat bundle is by using a terminal. Alternatively, a git-client with a GUI (such as SmartGit) can be used. 

Cloning Tudat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For **Linux or Mac**, the regular terminal can be used directly. For Linux, you can use the command :literal:`ctrl + alt + T`, whereas for Mac, you can simply search for Terminal via spotlight (invoked with :literal:`âŒ˜ + space`).

**Windows** users are recommended to use the :literal:`tudat_shell.bat`, located in :literal:`tudatBundle/external/tools`, `here <https://github.com/Tudat/tudatBundle/blob/master/external/tools/tudat_shell.bat>`_. Copy the contents into a plain text file, and save it as :literal:`tudat_shell.bat`.  Running this script will open a Windows terminal, with the git, make and cmake commands available.

After opening a terminal, navigate to the directpry where you want to download tudatBundle. You can use the :literal:`ls` command to get a listing of the current directory. To navigate 'up' one level (from :literal:`..../directoryA/directoryB/` to :literal:`..../directoryA/`), use the :literal:`cd ..` command. For the inverse (from :literal:`..../directoryA/` to :literal:`..../directoryA/directoryB/`) use :literal:`cd directoryB`.

.. warning:: If you are working on a Windows system, it is **highly recommended** that you place the Tudat Bundle directly in your C:\\ (or D:\\, E:\\, ... ) drive, as **failing to do so has been known to cause compilation errors**, requiring the installation to be redone. Mac and Linux users are not constrained in where to place the bundle.

If you are a Windows user **make sure to follow the warning above**. In the directory where tudatBundle is to be downloaded, enter the command::

    git clone https://github.com/tudat/tudatBundle.git

This will download the basic folder structure of the Tudat bundle. Once the process is complete, use the following commands::

    cd tudatBundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Note that the last command in particular can take some time, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

.. note:: This whole process is known to be decidedly slower on Windows than on Mac/Linux. 

Create a GitHub Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those users who want to push their Tudat code to Github (including students taking the AE4866 and AE4868 courses), a Github account is required. Create an account `here <https://github.com/join?source=header-home>`_, if you haven't done so yet. 

A GitHub account is completely free and provides you with hosting for your software projects. It also allows you to fork other repositories to create your own improved version of a piece of code.

As a student you can upgrade your free account to a personal account (normally $7/month). With a personal account you can have unlimited private repositories. Private repositories can be very helpful when developing new unreleased programs and/or writing your thesis. Applying for the free upgrade is easily done via `this <https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new>`_ link and tick boxes: Student and Individual account. Then enter the requested information.
